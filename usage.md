# Usage

Pressing escape first deselects the selected secondary issues, then the selected context,
then the selected issue.

Double click list items will provide edit menus for contexts and issues. 

Double click on the sidebar will open an editor for the description of the selected context or issue.

Hold control to not show action buttons for list items, which allows then for clicking
secondary context badges in order to jump into the indicated context. Alternatively, first hold right-click. This will prevent the action buttons to be shown, then point to a secondary context badge
and release the right-click (or left-click, which will act on its release) when hovering over the corresponding badge.

When creating a new issue, one can set the short title immediately by including a bar, like in "short title | title". Everything after the first bar is used as the title.
